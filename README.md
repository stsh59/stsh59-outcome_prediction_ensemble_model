# stsh59-outcome_prediction_ensemble_model
This project aims to predict critical ICU outcomes: patient survival (whether they will survive their ICU stay) and length of stay (days spent in the ICU). Using detailed patient data and advanced AI techniques, we strive to improve decision-making and enhance patient care in critical care settings.
